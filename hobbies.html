          <h3>Networking</h3>
          <p>
            I have been interested in setting up network switches, and routers, by flashing my router with an
            open-source firmware called
            <a href="https://freshtomato.org/" target="_blank">FreshTomato.</a>
            Netgear's original firmware caused the Wi-Fi to constantly drop every week, I just had enough of rebooting
            my router every time the Wi-Fi dropped. So far, I have not had any problems with the open-source firmware.

          <h3>Electrical</h3>
          <p>
            I'm not an electrician but I enjoy repairing/replacing an electrical outlet and using a multimeter to check
            continuity, voltage, and resistance.

          <h3>Video games</h3>
          <p>
            I'm not a true PC gamer but I love Nintendo games especially a huge fan of the Super Mario series, my
            favorite game from that series is the Super Mario Galaxy 2. Currently playing <em>'Kirby Return to
              Dreamland'</em>

          <h3>Repairs</h3>
          <p>
            When things break down or stop working, I try to make every effort to figure out what is wrong with it. I
            have done HVAC repairs replacing the hot surface igniter on a gas furnace &amp; replaced a Control board on
            a washing machine that stopped mid-cycle.

          <h3>Cycling</h3>
          <p>
            Enjoy my summer days with a bike ride across the neighborhood, really wished there were more bike lanes and
            space on the streets, but cars are more important here.

          <h3>Meditation</h3>
          <p>
            As someone who suffers from GAD (Generalized anxiety disorder) and Dysthymic Disorder (Depression)
            Meditation helps by focusing on the present time and calming me down when I feel stressed out.
