          <h3>Networking</h3>
          I've been interested in setting up network switches, routers, and flashing my router with an open-source
          firmware
          called <a href="https://freshtomato.org/" target="_blank">FreshTomato.</a> <br> Netgear's original firmware
          caused the wifi to constantly drop every week,
          just had enough of rebooting my router every time the wifi dropped. So far I haven't had any problems with the
          open-source firmware.

          <h3>Electrical</h3>
          I'm not an electrician but enjoy the satisfaction of repairing a loose electrical outlet and using a
          multimeter.

          <h3>Video games</h3>
          Not a PC gamer but love Nintendo games especially a big fan of the Super Mario series,
          my favorite game from that series is the Super Mario Galaxy 2.

          <h3>Repairs</h3>
          When things break down or stop working, I try my best to figure out what wrong with it.
          I have done HVAC repairs like replacing the hot surface igniter on a gas furnace that kept turning off.
          And replaced a Control board on a washing machine that stopped mid cycle.

          <h3>Cycling</h3>
          Enjoy my summer days with a bike ride across the neighborhood

          <h3>Meditation</h3>
          As someone who suffers from GAD (Generalized anxiety disorder) and Dysthymic Disorder (Depression)
          Meditation helps by focusing into the present time.
